WHAT IS POLYMORPHISM?

Poly means many forms. So it is basically means different types 
of the object. Polymorphism is a way of defining multiple 
functionalities under the same name. In other words we can say that 
we have the same code or operation but it will behave differently 
in different contexts.

IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT POLYMORPHISM

A functionality can behave differently for different instances
The behavior depends on the type of data used in the operation
Polymorphism is used for implementing inheritance.


ADVANTAGES OF POLYMORPHISM

1. It helps programmers reuse the code and classes once written, 
   tested and implemented. They  can be reused in many ways.

2. Single variable name can be used to store variables of multiple 
   data types(Float, double,   Long, Int etc).

3. Polymorphism helps in reducing the coupling between different functionalities.


DISADVANTAGES OF POLYMORPHISM


1. One of the disadvantages of polymorphism is that developers find 
   it difficult to implement  polymorphism in codes.

2. Run time polymorphism can lead to the performance issue as machine 
   needs to decide which method or variable to invoke so it basically 
   degrades the performances as decisions are taken at run time.

3. Polymorphism reduces the readability of the program. One needs to identify 
   the runtime behavior of the program to identify actual execution time.
