	ABSTRACTION	                                                                   
1.	Abstraction is the process or method of gaining the information.        	
2.	In abstraction, problems are solved at the design or interface level.	    
3.	Abstraction is the method of hiding the unwanted information.	            
4.	We can implement abstraction using abstract class and interfaces.	        
5.	In abstraction, implementation complexities are hidden                      
    using abstract classes and interfaces.	
6.	The objects that help to perform abstraction are encapsulated.	           


 ENCAPSULATION
1. While encapsulation is the process or method to contain the information.
2. While in encapsulation, problems are solved at the implementation level.
3. Whereas encapsulation is a method to hide the data in a single entity or 
   unit along with a method to protect information from outside.
4. Whereas encapsulation can be implemented using by access modifier 
   i.e. private, protected and public.
5. While in encapsulation, the data is hidden using methods of getters and setters.
 
6. Whereas the objects that result in encapsulation need not be abstracted.
